## Features

- **Movie Catalog** — Displays a grid of movies loaded from a local JSON file, each showing the poster, title, director, IMDB rating (as stars), genre, year, age rating, and language.
- **Search** — Filter movies by title or director name in real time.
- **Filters** — Narrow results by genre, age group (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17), and release year.
- **Sorting** — Sort movies by year (newest/oldest), IMDB rating (high/low), or title (A→Z / Z→A).
- **Watchlist** — Add or remove movies from a personal Watchlist using the heart icon on each card. The list persists across page reloads via `localStorage`.
- **Already Watched** — Mark movies as watched using the eye icon. Also persists via `localStorage`.
- **PDF Download** — Download either list (Watchlist or Already Watched) as a formatted PDF file directly from the side drawer.
- **Pagination** — Movies are displayed 12 per page. Filters and sorting reset to page 1 automatically.
- **Toast Notifications** — Feedback messages appear when adding/removing movies or when no results match the current filters.
- **Loading Screen** — An animated loader is shown for at least 2 seconds while movie data is being fetched.
- **Responsive Design** — Layout adapts from 1 to 4 columns depending on screen size.

## How It Works

1. On load, the app fetches movie data from `/public/movie.json`.
2. The `SearchBar` component provides a text input and four dropdowns (genre, age group, year, sort order).
3. Filtering and sorting are computed with `useMemo` so the UI stays responsive.
4. Each `MovieCard` shows the movie poster as a background image with a gradient overlay. Hovering reveals the short description, runtime, and budget.
5. Clicking the heart button toggles a movie in the **Watchlist**; clicking the eye button toggles it in **Already Watched**.
6. Both lists are accessible via the icons in the **Navbar**. Each opens a side drawer listing the saved movies with a Remove button and a Download List button.
7. The Download button uses `@react-pdf/renderer` to generate and download a PDF with the movie title, year, genre, IMDB rating, and runtime for each entry.
